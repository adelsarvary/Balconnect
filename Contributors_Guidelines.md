# **Contributor guidelines for the *Balconnect* project**

First of all, thank you for considering to contribute to this initiative!

The Balconnect project has grown from initial efforts by Adel Sarvary to highlight the ecological importance of outdoor ornamental plants raised in metropolitan areas, and to change the current market demand under the motto 'plants are more than decorations'. 

This is currently a completely independent initiative.

Please check out our roadmap and our community's [code of conduct](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/blob/main/Code_of_Conduct.md) to help you get started, and the [home page](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect) for an overview of the project (if you have not read it yet)!

Below you can find the main guidelines for contributing to the *Balconnect* project. This repository is available under [CC BY 4.0 license](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/blob/main/LICENSE), so you are welcome to use, reuse, remix, share and build upon the existing materials. We appreciate all your suggestions and contributions.

## **How can I contribute?**

Any person - regardless of having or not having plants, living in metropolitan areas or not, or having access to any outdoor spaces to grow plants at or not - can participate in this project. 

There are different ways in which you can contribute and hence different degrees of involvement:

### Translations
The project and the first prototypes are being developed in Barcelona, Spain, therefore we would like to make all documents available in both Spanish and English. Of course, Catalan is more than welcome, too!
    
We are looking for anyone to help us with translation of the following documents:
    
- [README](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/blob/main/README.md)
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/blob/main/Roadmap.md)
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/blob/main/Code_of_Conduct.md)
- Contributors' Guidelines (the document you are currently reading)
    
All Spanish version files will be placed in this directory: [https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/tree/main/SPANISH](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/tree/main/SPANISH)
