### Create a documentation methodology & space to assist the continuous communication about Balconnect's mission and principles to anyone interested.
    
### Topics:
    
* The '4 pillars of Balconnect' and the importance of people-plant interaction.
* Catalunya native plant list
* The most important changes Balconnect aims to achieve & the research questions it aims to answer.
* Storyline & lessons learned 06/2020-12/2021
* The science and knowledge base Balconnect is building on.
    
### Tasks:
    
1. Document a presencial and virtual 'People-Plant Interaction' workshop script & material.
    1. Full script in English and Spanish (incl. topic ideas for a 2.0 workshop)
    2. Plant details cards
    3. Destiny plant (Arduino code, KiCad Schematics, pics)
2. Define target groups (users, experts, sponsors)
3. Find & document the language of the project both in EN & ES [keywords, glossary]
4. Create a simple EN-ES website for Balconnect (intro, products, project status, contact).
5. Write '3-min-read' blog posts e.g. Medium articles, referencing to all resources that inspire Balconnect and underpin both its 'why' and 'how'.
6. Update & push introduction via Planteka & Replantem channels, gain email addresses & followers on Twitter & IG
7. Tweet / IG the most interesting facts & news from the above topics on a regular (weekly) basis.


## Milestone 2 [Short term]: 
### Establish a working group of early adopters - contributors and users    
    
### Preparation:
    
* Create a roadmap towards the first proof of concept prototype detailing the different options to get involved
* Work out a community management strategy that includes
  - set-up of collaboration space & communication channels [GitHub, Slack, Telegram, etc.]
  - welcome pack [all-in-one go-to document]
  - weekly calls schedule and minutes template
  - collaboration, openness & documentation guidelines
  - status update [internal newsletter] templates
 * Define collaboration with experts (e.g. scientific objectives & feasibility) + research expert target groups
    
### Action:
    
* Open call for early adopter expert & user volunteers on Twitter & IG
* Introduce project on WorkOnClimate & ask for early adopter expert volunteers
* Define collaboration with users + send emails to workshop participants (Slack invite)
* Introduce project & announce workshops on Planet Venus and BCN Gardening FB group
* Based on working group experience, script the community management strategy for the first prototype (channels, timing etc. for collaboration & communication)


## Milestone 3 [Medium term, by 04/2022]: 
### First proof of concept prototype
    
* Research reference projects esp. open ones for data collection, processing and visualisation
* Establish workflow and framework for data management ([EUDAT](https://sp.eudat.eu/catalog/))
* Research and select the app & server for data collection to be used for prototype
* Collaborate with early adopters to collect real raw data and to test prototype in real situations over a period of 3 months
* Surveys and documentation about experiences & feedback
* Document and publish steps of engagement and usage
* Visualise and publish collected data ([Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/))
  
  
## Milestone 4 [Medium term]: 
### Find sponsors
    
* Research & list all possibilities for funds & awards
   * [https://empreses.barcelonactiva.cat/es_ES/web/es/tots-els-programes](https://empreses.barcelonactiva.cat/es_ES/web/es/tots-els-programes)
* Collect all data & define all aspects of the project that are needed for funds applications.
* Opportunities:

## Milestone 5 [Medium term]: 
### Launch Balconnect device
    
* Document device design & production process from 07/2020
* Research reference devices esp. open source ones
* Brainstorm & design possible uses of device with community
* Find & contact a lead technician e.g. Josep from FabLab Barcelona to conduct production
* First proof of concept prototype
* Collaborate with community to test device prototype, document feedback, brainstorm on other device uses & design


## Milestone 6 [Long term]: 
### Extended communication to reach wider (and international) audience for possible more collaboration & opportunities

* Collaborate with personal role models & favourite media e.g.
  * Dr. Niki Wallace, Marielle Anzelone
  * 'In Defense of Plants' podcast & blog, The Ethnobotanical Assembly, Emergence Magazine, and involve community in nature writing
   
* Start an Open Podcast interviewing plant owners & experts of different regions
