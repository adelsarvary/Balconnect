# **Code of conduct**

This project values the participation of every member of our community and wants to ensure that every contributor has an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in the Balconnect project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.

This project is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. Harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form is not tolerated.

Anyone who is a new and/or anxious contributers, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past is readily encouraged to take part and get help from other contributors.

To make clear what is expected, all members of the community are asked to conform to the following Code of Conduct.

- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors.
- Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

*Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.*

Members of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the project, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Adel Sarvary. If inappropriate behaviour persists, the contributor will be asked to discontinue their participation in the project.
