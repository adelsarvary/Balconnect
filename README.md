## **About the project**

Balconnect is a green initiative addressing the biodiversity crisis and our growing disconnection from nature in metropolitan areas, by highlighting the ecological importance of ornamental plants raised on urban balconies, windowsills, terraces and backyards.

The project aims at building knowledge-based people-plant interactions using open, community-focused practices and augmented collaborative learning, while mapping and building a structured network of metropolitan outdoor ornamental plants.

As the open database is being built, participants could gradually:

* Document and visualise their personal eco-legacy by learning and sharing nature with their communities (through data, experiences, plants, cultural products, etc.).
* Increase market demand for locally cultivated and native plants.
* Consciously create biodiverse green patches in private outdoor areas.
* Collect valuable data and conduct open research for science.
* Make cities more liveable, reducing urban green inequalities.
* Influence local government decisions on city planning, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions.

## **Who are we?**

The founder of this project is me, [Adel Sarvary](https://adelsarvary.github.io/), a transdisciplinary creative communications & digital collaborations professional and systemic designer. 

The birth & initial development of Balconnect took place during my 'Design for Emergent Futures' Master's course (MDEF), in 2020, under the caring wings of the wonderful teaching staff at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunya (IaaC) & at Elisava School of Design and Engineering in Barcelona, Spain.

Balconnect has since been growing into an Open Science project, thanks to the amazing help of my mentor [Emma Karoune](https://github.com/EKaroune), and the founders and community of [Open Life Science](https://github.com/open-life-science).

For further information about the growing list of people and communities I am greatly thankful for, please see [Acknowledgements](https://github.com/adelsarvary/Balconnect/blob/main/Acknowledgements.md).

In case you are interested in hopping in the front seat with me, please do reach out!

## **How to get involved?**
